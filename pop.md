## Synopsis
2-5 sentence description of project outcome. Think about "intellectual merit" (why is this cool for learning) and "broader impact" (why is it good if we succeed).

"Our game is aimed to be a graphical implementation of the game 'Sudoku'. We intend to use C++ to
create a game that will challenge us with using data structures and programming tactics and techniques to reflect our skillsets.
We will become more experienced with programming if we succeed with this project and it will help us learn how to work in a group setting"
