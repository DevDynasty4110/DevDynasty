# Project Proposal Overview

## Details
Team Name: Dev Dynasty

Team Members:

* Alex McDaniel
* Sam Medley 
* Michael Sloan
* Liam Tolkkinen

## Synopsis
2-5 sentence description of project outcome. Think about "intellectual merit" (why is this cool for learning) and "broader impact" (why is it good if we succeed).

"Our game is aimed to be a graphical implementation of the game 'Sudoku'. We intend to use C++ to
create a game that will challenge us with using data structures and programming tactics and techniques to reflect our skillsets.
We will become more experienced with programming if we succeed with this project and it will help us learn how to work in a group setting"

## Components
* Backend Development (2 parts)
  * Part 1 (Game Logic):
      * Lead: (NAME)
      - verify that a proposed solution is valid (when the entries are submitted)
      - Alert the user when they enter a duplicate value in a row/colunm/square
      - Save current progress to a file
      - Save scores calculated by difficulty, hints used, and time that it was completed in
      - communicate with the auto solver when a hint or completion is needed
  * Part 2 (Auto Complete/solver):
  	* Lead: (NAME)
      - take the current board and verify if the current entries are correct
      	(this will be necessary if the user starts filling out the board and needs a hint)
      - if a hint is needed, generate the next correct move
      - if an auto complete is needed, fill out the board with the correct entries
* Frontend Development (2 Parts)
  * Part 1 (Shell Design):
      - Lead: (NAME)
      - Make a menu
      	- Menu: Difficulty options, pause (pauses the timer), quit, load game (find game file to load), etc...
      - Make a timer for the game??
  * Part 2 (Board Design):
      - Lead: (Name)
      - Actual game experience
      - Design the board
      - Collect user input for backend processing
